<!--

This sample contct form has been provided by AccuFind Internet Services.

In an effort to make your migration to our company as easy as possible, we have provided a 
simple contact form that utilizes the script provided in your cgi-bin folder.

INSTRUCTIONS
There are three fields required for the sitemail.pl script to operate properly:

<input type="hidden" name="recipient" value="your@emailaddress.com">
<input type="hidden" name="subject="value="Web Form Subject">
<input type="hidden" name="redirect" value="/index.html">

The fields above are examples of the hidden fields. You will need to change the values of the 
fields to your criteria.

Please replace the sample email address within the form with your own email address.
The email address must be valid for the script to work properly.

Once this is complete, and you have made the necessary changes to the sitemail.pl script itself, 
you can open the form in a browser and enter your an email address in the text field and submit the form. 

Once the form has been tested properly and you are satisfied that it is working, you can begin to add additional
fields as needed and build your webpage around the form.

The form used is a copy of Matt's Form Mail script. However other versions of this script have proven 
to be insecure and are not recommended. In addition, we have renamed the form to avoid internet scanners 
which are used by unauthorized users, in an attempt to exploit the older versions of the script.
